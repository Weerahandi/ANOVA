# ANOVA
Analysis of Variance under Unequal Variances
R Code Developed by Sam Weerahandi (retired) and Malwane Ananda of UNLV.

The basic usage is that with the R Code you can test null hypotheses of the equality of two or more populations. 
After compiling the R-code you run test as in: out=oneway.anova(Y~X,data), where
- X is the vector of population numbers/factors
- Y is the vector of the corresponding values of the response variable,
and data is the data.frame containing such data.

Examples page provide clearer idea about how to prepare the data file.
